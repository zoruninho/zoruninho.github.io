<p>An online acquaintance wanted to try to create a little <strong>video game</strong> with some of his friends. His project was an RPG game, with some <strong>forest </strong>moments. </p>
<p>I decided to help him by doing a little <strong>sound </strong>which would have fit with this forest environment and here is the <strong>result </strong>! At first it was with a high rhythm and would have been quickly <strong>annoying</strong>. Now I think it's more adapted to a video game and I kinda like this one. </p>
