<p>I <strong>won't </strong>post on this website any "music" I made before <strong>Wurd</strong>. There is a good reason to that, it's mostly very <strong>bad </strong>stuff from my learning period. I'm still learning a <strong>lot </strong>at each session, and the global quality is not so good, but it's <strong>far </strong>away from these first tries.</p>
<p>But one night came <strong>Wurd </strong>from the middle of nowhere. It was like at 1am, I was hesitating between doing something or going to sleep, and I finally decided to launch my <strong>FL Studio</strong> program. After 2 hours of non-stop producing, <strong>Wurd </strong>was born. The beginning of the song is quite bad, but this is clearly my sound with the most unique "<strong>atmosphere</strong>". When I listen to it, I can imagine a short scene with someone <strong>running away</strong> from someone else. The same feeling was shared by a friend. </p>
<p>It's still far from perfect, far from pretty good, but I think it's my <strong>favorite </strong>sound. </p>
