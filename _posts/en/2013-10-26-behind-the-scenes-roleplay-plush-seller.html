<p>For this first Behind The Scenes post, I will talk about a recent video and the steps of its production ! </p>
<p>As you can see in the image ahead, I have to prepare all the stuff I will use in a video. But it's easy. On the other side, placing the camera and the microphone is not. </p>
<p>I have to place the microphone close to me, but it mustn't be visible in the video so I have to play with the angles for several minutes before shooting. </p>

<p>When everything is ready, I launch Audacity to record the audio and my video recording can begin !</p>
<p><a href="/images/bts/plush/image3.jpg"><img src="/images/bts/plush/image3.jpg" alt="image3" width="300" height="225"/></a></p>
<p>During this recording session, all went fine and I can save the audio kindly prepared by audacity. </p>

<p>Before processing the audio and make some modifications to it, I have to copy the recorded video into my computer. </p>

<p>When the sound is correctly modified, I start the editing of the final vid ! </p>
<p><a href="/images/bts/plush/image5.jpg"><img src="/images/bts/plush/image5.jpg" alt="image5" width="300" height="187"/></a></p>
<p>After all that work, which can take 30 minutes or several hours depending on the video, I launch the rendering and then upload the result on youtube. </p>
<p>I think i will make some tutorials to explain all the steps explained in this post, don't hesitate to comment to tell me what you would like to see in these type of posts !</p>
