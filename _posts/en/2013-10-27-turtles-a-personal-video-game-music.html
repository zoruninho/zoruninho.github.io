<p>During my <strong>first </strong>year of studying in my UIT, we had to create a little <strong>video game</strong> based on a board game for kids. I may talk about it in another post in my <strong>project </strong>category ! </p>
<p>With my partner, we finished <strong>earlier </strong>than expected, so I took a little of my free time to create some <strong>musics </strong>for the game. The main one is here : <strong>Turtles</strong>. </p>
<p>I made it while thinking about <strong>old </strong>video game themes, and chose what I thought to be an adequate <strong>synthesizer</strong>. I hope you will like this one ! </p>
