<p><strong>During </strong>my 2 years of studying in my University Institute of Technology, I have to conduct an informatic <strong>project </strong>for a client, working in a team with 3 friends. </p>
<p>There were a lot of different projects, from the <strong>Connect Four 3D game</strong> to the <strong>reeducation-helping software</strong>. With my teammates, we chose the project : "Web app to learn the <strong>vocabulary </strong>of foreign languages". </p>
<p>The <strong>client </strong>was an older student in informatic in the UIT too. He thinks that it's difficult to <strong>enjoy </strong>learning the vocabulary of a foreign language, and wants a website which could make this <strong>funnier </strong>or at least less <strong>boring</strong>. </p>
<p>So we checked the current language-learning <strong>websites </strong>and we found some lacking features in these ones. Our goal is to offer these new <strong>functionalities </strong>with an sober and elegant website. </p>
<p>We have until <strong>February 2014</strong> to finish this project, I will make some other posts to talk about our <strong>progress </strong>in the development !</p>
<p>If you have any idea or functionality you would like to see in a website like this, don't hesitate to <strong>comment </strong>!</p>
