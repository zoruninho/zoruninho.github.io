An online acquaintance wanted to try to create a little **video game** with some of his friends. His project was an RPG game, with some **forest** moments.

I decided to help him by doing a little **sound** which would have fit with this forest environment and here is the **result** ! At first it was with a high rhythm and would have been quickly **annoying**. Now I think it's more adapted to a video game and I kinda like this one.
