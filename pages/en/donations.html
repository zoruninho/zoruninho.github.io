<p>If you want, you can help me by making a donation. This would be much appreciated for several reasons :</p>
<p>- Hosting this website has an annual cost<br />
- Get better recording devices is kind of expensive<br />
- All my work is totally free for everyone</p>
<p>So if you want to make me a gift, you just have to click on the Paypal banner and follow the instructions ! When I receive your donation, I add your name as soon as possible to the list situated below this text. If you don't want to be on the list, don't hesitate to leave a message with your gift or to contact me !</p>
<p>You also can offer me a gift from this amazon wishlist : <a class="fasc-button fasc-size-large fasc-type-flat" style="background-color: #33809e; color: #ffffff;" href="http://www.amazon.fr/registry/wishlist/2QHC00A52BKP5?sort=universal-price-desc&view=null&itemPerPage=25" target="_blank" data-fasc-style="background-color:#33809e;color:#ffffff;">My Amazon Wishlist</a></p>
