Hi !

I'm a 21 year old french student currently living in Normandy.

I create [ASMR videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/Zoruasmr "my channel"), which are relaxing ones. If you want to learn more about ASMR, go check the [Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_sensory_meridian_response "wikipedia asmr")!

I studied maths, physics and chemistry one year in a preparatory class but then I decided to go to an UIT to study computer science. I loved it during two years, got my degree, and now I'm in an engineering school, also in order to study computer science. You can find some of my personal projects [here](http://www.zoru.co/category/projects/ "projects").

I also try to create music sometimes, you can listen to it and learn a little more about each song when I'm making articles about them [right there](http://www.zoru.co/category/music/ "music").

And if you want, you can help me to improve my videos by making a donation ! It's entirely up to you.
